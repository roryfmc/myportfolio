                                        This book explains the idea of web3 and what It involves as well as the steps needed In order to transition from Web2 - Web3. It also touches on the negative uses of Web3
                                         and how It could lead to this dystopian future. The book opened my eyes to the future of not only tech but the world and the possible technologies that will exist in

                                        in terms of dense content but more trying to wrap your head round particular theories. The role of the dog helps massively and as someone not particularly versed in physics 
                                        helped massively in understanding the concepts put forth. I also read this book to say I was reading a book about quantum physics. Good book.

                                         as long as you keep In mind that Its raw and meant to be juvenile, leading to a very honest book about his experince.

                                        the amount of different and invaluable content in this book makes up for it. At times it was a bit of a hard read just because of the vasts amount of information.
