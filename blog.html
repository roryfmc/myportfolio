                                         task to do manually at the moment because of worldwide shortages. The origins of the project involved pitching to the University
                                          staff for an opportunity to do this project. Around 30 teams pitched for the opportunity and 3 were successful, including mine.
                                          The project allowed me to gain many new skills such as a better understanding of Agile and Test Driven Devlopment, as well as this 
                                          I got to gain further experience into Object Orientated Programming which has bettered my programming abilities. The project didn't come
                                          without it's challenges, the web application required more research than I originally thought as well as lengthy amounts of trial and error
                                          using different techniques and libraries. Overall, the experience with being able to work so closely to a company was incredibly 
                                          useful, I picked up many different new qualities which have made me a better communicator, programmer and team mate.

                                        web scraping is getting denied access to the website after multiple requests. This is because the website most likely thinks its a possible
                                        attack. To get round this issue I resorted to making a proxy rotator. The proxy rotator first scrapes from a free proxy website and then tests
                                         each one. The main and obvious problem with this is the lifespan of free proxies. By the time the algorithm tests the proxies, they are already
                                          not working. Before going into this project I knew this would be an issue. Despite this the project did allow me to learn more about proxies and 
                                          ports as well as testing them.

                                         amazed me. I understand the whole concept of NFTs and still dont find the appeal in the area. Despite this however I saw the ridiculous amounts of 
                                         money being produced and decided to take a shot. After researching how the big market leading collections created their unique NFTs I found there 
                                         was a lack of information surrounding the process. After querying reddits I came across generative-art-node a opensource repo created by HashLips.
                                         I modified the algorithm for my own use and imported my own layers which then created 679 unique NFTs. After all of this, I came across the biggest 
                                         hurdle, money. In order to add the NFTs to OpenSea I would have to pay a Gasfee so that the transaction could be conducted on the Ethereum blockchain.
                                         I also had the problem of creating 679 unqiue smart contracts for each NFT because of these problems I decieded to shelf the project.

                                        measures put in place and enforced by University security. Despite the lockdown and enforcement parties and gatherings were inevitable, If 
                                        thousands of first year students are placed in halls together Its bound to happen. The main fear from attending / hosting gatherings and parties 
                                        was fines from security and reprimands from the University if caught. This fear led to me creating a colour detection algorithm which would target 
                                        security hi-vis yellow. This involved exploring new technologies and the use of masks so that the computer could distinguish colours. This algorithm
                                         was linked to a camera that was strategically placed on a window looking at the accomodation entrance which would alert me if the target colour was detected.
                                         This project gave me a massive insight into other python libraries as well as being great help to the student in the accomodation.

                                        for people of high risk and those scared of catching the virus. This problem led to me creating a web scraping algorithm specifically 
                                        for Tesco. The alogrithm would query the website every 30 minutes and send an email if a slot was available. I used technologies such as 
                                        selenium for the web scraping. This project was very helpful as it gave me an insight to other better web scraping technologies such as 
                                        BeautifulSoup and other types of projects that could assist the algorithms efficiency such as a Proxy Rotator.

                                         to expand its reach to clients. When presented with the opportunity to build their website I jumped on the opportunity. At the time
                                         I was not proficient in HTML or CSS and felt I would do them a disserivce by experimenting with the langauges at the point in time. 
                                         Instead I used Wix to build the website and although it is a straight forware application for building websites, the opportunity meant that
